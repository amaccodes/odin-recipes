        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A picture of fried chicken and lettuce in a plastic basket-like bowl tells a story far beyond its simplicity. The golden, crispy chicken rests confidently, its textured surface glistening with the memory of hot oil and savory seasoning. Nestled beside it, the crisp green lettuce adds a burst of freshness—a quiet companion to the bold, indulgent centerpiece. The plastic basket, though unassuming, cradles the meal like a familiar ritual, evoking the warmth of casual diners, late-night cravings, and comfort wrapped in convenience. It’s a moment suspended: the contrast of hot and cold, indulgence and balance, tradition and immediacy—all captured in a humble container that somehow makes the experience feel more real.</p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Take your cut up chicken pieces and skin them if you prefer.</li><br>
            <li>Place flour in a large plastic bag (let the amount of chicken you are cooking dictate the amount of flour you use). Season flour with paprika (which helps to brown the chicken), salt and pepper.</li><br>

            <li>Dip chicken pieces in buttermilk then, a few at a time, transfer them into the bag with flour; seal the bag and shake to coat well.</li><br>

            <li>Place the coated chicken on a cookie sheet or tray, and cover with a clean dish towel or waxed paper. LET SIT UNTIL THE FLOUR IS OF A PASTE-LIKE CONSISTENCY. THIS IS CRUCIAL!</li><br>

            <li>Fill a large skillet (cast iron is best) about 1/3 to 1/2 full with vegetable oil. Heat until VERY hot.</li><br>
            <li>Put in as many chicken pieces as the skillet can hold. Brown the chicken in HOT oil on both sides.</li><br>

            <li>When browned, reduce heat and cover skillet; let cook for 30 minutes (the chicken will be cooked through but not crispy). Remove cover, raise heat again, and continue to fry until crispy.</li><br>
            <li>Drain fried chicken on paper towels. Depending on how much chicken you have, you may have to fry in a few shifts. Keep the finished chicken in a slightly warm oven while preparing the rest.</li><br>
