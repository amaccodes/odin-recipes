        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and cook until softened, about 3 minutes.  Add ground beef, garlic, and jalapeno and cook, crumbling with a wooden spoon until browned, about 5 minutes. Stir in tomato sauce. Add water to the can to release any residual sauce; pour into the pan along with salt and pepper. Bring mixture to a simmer. Cook 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile,  bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Stir in noodles and cook until just tender with a bite; drain. Return noodles to the pot; stir in cream cheese and sour cream.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
            <li>Spread 1/2 cup sauce mixture into the bottom of dish.  Add half the noodle mixture and top with half the tomato sauce mixture. Sprinkle with half of Cheddar, then half of mozzarella. Repeat the layers with remaining ingredients.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until browned around the edges, bubbly, and heated through, about 30 minutes. Sprinkle with parsley.</li>
        </ol>
